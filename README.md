An Example PyGame Project.

## This is an old project
I did this project for fun about 5 years ago. I have completely forgotten PyGame! In fact, I didn't understand it back then; I 
was simply following a YouTube tutorial. 

## Will I pick up PyGame again?
... probably not. I could totally learn it quickly with the experience I have now. However, my focus has shifted towards 
using native frameworks. 

So that's using [Swift](https://swift.org) and the [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) framework. If I was
to make a game, I would just write it natively in Swift and then publish it on the App Store. 

So, although Pygame is a great framework, I most likely won't be using it again.
