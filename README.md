# Shmup
A 2D desktop arcade game. You're a spaceship that has to shoot down big rocks falling from the top of the screen.

## How it's made
This game is written in Python using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) library.

I followed along with [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGufy7weyGY).
